# Project3-1
To run the project, please run BabyWatcherUI.py that can be found in the BabyWatcherUI Folder.
It will be run as a localhost application. You will be able to inspect it via your web browser.\
Note: The application will crash if it does not find anything in the image. If that does happen, please reload the page and input an image that actually has baby features that can be detected. This issue will be fixed in phase 3.
